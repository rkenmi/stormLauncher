# Storm Launcher

Controls the Dream Cheeky [O.I.C Storm](http://www.dreamcheeky.com/storm-oic-missile-launcher) & [Thunder](http://www.dreamcheeky.com/thunder-missile-launcher) USB Missile Launchers.  

For Mac OS (tested working on Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.1) and Python 3 (3.6.3 works)

## Requirements

You need Python 3 for this script. 
Mac OS only comes with Python 2 by default, so you can install Python 3 with `brew install python3`.


## Getting Started:

    git clone git@github.com:rkenmi/stormLauncher.git
    cd stormLauncher
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    sudo chmod +x stormLauncher.py
    sudo python3 stormLauncher.py
